# assignment5_mda

## Overview

This assignment applies clustering techniques to economic indicators from various countries. The goal is to compare distance measures and clustering algorithms, and to visualize groupings using PCA.

## Tasks

1. Scale and center the data → matrix `Xs`
2. Compute Euclidean, Manhattan, and Mahalanobis distances
3. Apply hierarchical clustering with different distances and linkage methods
4. Apply k-means clustering and visualize in PCA space
5. Choose an appropriate number of clusters using a dendrogram and metrics
6. **Bonus**: Assess cluster stability with bootstrap
